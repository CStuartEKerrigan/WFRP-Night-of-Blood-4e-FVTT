Content for the [WFRP4e system](https://github.com/CatoThe1stElder/WFRP-4th-Edition-FoundryVTT) to be used with the [Foundry Virtual Tabletop](https://foundryvtt.com/). Based on the *Night of Blood* adventure, converted from Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay 1st Edition to Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay 4th Edition by Lindsay Law, for Cubicle 7.
