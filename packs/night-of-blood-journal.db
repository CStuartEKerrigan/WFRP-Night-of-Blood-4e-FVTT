This is @Actor[Fagor]{Fagor}, who has come up from the cellar to clean up evidence of the earlier assault on the inn. Unless the Characters go to have a look at what he is doing, he finishes after a few minutes and then takes his bloodstained mop and bucket into the kitchen. @Actor[Otto]{Otto} the &lsquo;landlord&rsquo; is nervous about the party&rsquo;s presence (given what is to happen later) and this shows in his mannerisms. He constantly fingers the bottom of his apron, twisting and turning it with suppressed tension. He attempts to send the Characters on their way as quickly as possible by claiming that the inn is full. @Actor[Otto]{Otto} makes no effort to make the party feel welcome. He has a coach party in residence, who have just retired for the night, and he &lsquo;wants no&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;ladies and gentlemen&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;of the Characters<em>&rsquo; kind tonight, thank you&rsquo;</em>.</p>\n<p>If the party insists on staying (unless they wish to die at the hands of whatever lurks in the forest), @Actor[Otto]{Otto} eventually (and grudgingly) allows them to do so. He continues to behave ungraciously &mdash; any drinks, for example, are served in unwashed tankards.</p>\n<p>Eventually @Actor[Otto]{Otto} heads into the kitchen with a muttered,&nbsp;<em>&lsquo;I suppose you want feeding as well...&rsquo;</em>&nbsp;He is actually leaving to organise the rest of the Mutants while @Actor[Hans Jinkerest]{Hans} keeps the Characters occupied. @Actor[Hans Jinkerest]{Hans}, in his guise as a road warden, questions the Characters in an attempt to find out who and what they are. @Actor[Hans Jinkerest]{Hans} asks his questions in his &lsquo;official&rsquo; capacity, using the excuse that he believes the Characters to be Bandits. If the Characters mention the ferry, @Actor[Hans Jinkerest]{Hans} claims it was attacked (and the ferryman carried off ) by Bandits. This, he explains is why the inn is so securely locked.</p>\n<p>He also manages to imply that the Characters are in league with these same (non-existent) bandits:&nbsp;<em>&lsquo;I think your sudden appearance has unnerved the landlord. Mind you, he could be right ... Who else would be out on a night such as this?&rsquo;</em>&nbsp;@Actor[Hans Jinkerest]{Hans} is clever enough not to press this line of argument too far, and he seems to be satisfied by any reasonable story the Characters care to tell him.</p>\n<p>If the party mentions the Mutant in the stables, @Actor[Hans Jinkerest]{Hans} is surprised. He believes all the Mutants to be hiding in the inn. He feigns further shock when told of the body:&nbsp;<em>&lsquo;The landlord assured me that the stable boy had run off. No one bothered checking for him up there. Well, he can wait till morning to be buried.&rsquo;</em></p>\n<p>If the Characters mention either the body or @Actor[Grat]{Grat} to @Actor[Otto]{Otto} he looks very worried and shocked. However, his real fear is the Characters have uncovered the Mutants&rsquo; business here. He changes the subject and looks to @Actor[Hans Jinkerest]{Hans} to bail him out.</p>\n<p>Once @Actor[Hans Jinkerest]{Hans} is sure that the Characters have no official connections, he excuses himself and goes into the kitchen. Characters who state they are watching @Actor[Hans Jinkerest]{Hans} as he leaves will notice his &lsquo;wound&rsquo; and the bloodstain with a successful&nbsp;<strong>Average (+20) Perception</strong>&nbsp;Test.</p>\n<p>By now the Characters should be suspicious and be trying to find out what is going on. A Character stood at the bar can overhear @Actor[Hans Jinkerest]{Hans} and @Actor[Otto]{Otto} in the kitchen. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t panic, @Actor[Otto]{Otto}. They are only travellers. Tzeentch will be pleased to have their souls as well. Use the&nbsp;<em>kurts&nbsp;</em>in their food and we&rsquo;ll deal with them later.&rsquo; @Actor[Hans Jinkerest]{Hans} then passes @Actor[Otto]{Otto} the phial containing the&nbsp;<em>kurts</em>. After this @Actor[Otto]{Otto} has the phial in his possession.</p>\n<p>If @Actor[Hans Jinkerest]{Hans} hears anyone attempting to sneak into the kitchen he comes back into the bar. He closes the door into the kitchen with an air of finality, making it very awkward for anyone to push past without a very good reason.</p>\n<p>A short while later @Actor[Otto]{Otto} returns bearing bowls of hot stew. Each bowl contains two doses of&nbsp;<em>kurts</em>. Characters should make a&nbsp;<strong>Very Hard (-30) Perception</strong>&nbsp;Test to notice its taste in the food.
